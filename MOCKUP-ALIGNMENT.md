## ðŸ”„ Minor Gaps (Easy to Add)

### 1. Pipeline Kanban View
**Mockup:** Drag-and-drop cards across stages

**Current:** We have deal stages in data model, just need UI

**Effort:** 2-3 days (Phase 3)

**Priority:** High - core UX

---

### 2. Dashboard Metrics
**Mockup Shows:**
- Revenue: $847K
- Active Deals: 47
- Conversion Rate: 68%
- New Contacts: 234
- Hot Deals list
- AI-Powered Insights
- Today's Tasks

**Current:** We have `/stats/summary` endpoint, need UI

**Effort:** 3-4 days (Phase 2 - already planned!)

**Priority:** High - management visibility

---

### 3. Contact Management
**Mockup:** Full contacts list with:
- Search
- Segment filtering
- Status badges
- Company linking
- Role tracking

**Current:** We have Person/Company models, need UI

**Effort:** 2-3 days (Phase 3)

**Priority:** Medium

---

### 4. AI Insights Panel
**Mockup Shows:**
- "Acme Corp contact replied 3x faster than average - high interest detected"
- "TechStart Inc deal inactive for 4 days - recommended follow-up"
- "Best time to contact new leads: 10-11 AM (40% higher response)"

**Current:** Basic extraction, no behavioral insights yet

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (Phase 4 or 5)

**Priority:** Medium - nice-to-have

---
