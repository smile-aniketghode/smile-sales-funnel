Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. We've been following your company's work and are very impressed with your recent projects.

We have an exciting opportunity that we'd like to discuss with you. Our board has approved a â‚¹62,50,000 budget for a new digital transformation project, and we believe your team would be perfect for this.

Here's what we need:

1. Could you please send us a detailed project proposal by this Friday? We're on a tight timeline.

2. We'd also like to schedule a call next week to discuss the technical requirements and timeline in more detail.

3. Please include pricing for both the initial phase and the full project scope.

This is a high-priority project for us, and we're looking to get started as soon as possible. The project involves modernizing our customer portal and integrating it with our new CRM system.

Let me know if you need any additional information from our side.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
