## Test Scenario 2: Multiple Customers

### Repeat with Different Senders

**Email #2:**
- From: Different email address
- Subject: CRM Solution for Growing Team
- Budget: â‚¹15 lakhs
- Expected: 1 deal, 2 tasks, 1 contact

**Email #3:**
- From: Another different email
- Subject: API Integration Questions
- No budget mentioned
- Expected: 0 deals, 2 tasks, 1 contact

### Verify Multi-Customer Separation

Run:
```bash
python3 tests/quick_api_test.py
```

**Expected:**
- âœ… 3 separate contacts (different emails)
- âœ… All data belongs to aniket.ghode@shreemaruti.com
- âœ… No duplicate deals or tasks

---

## Test Scenario 3: Idempotency

### Send Same Email Twice

1. Forward one of the previous test emails to yourself again
2. Wait for worker to process (60s)
3. Check API/UI

**Expected:**
- âœ… NO duplicate deals
- âœ… NO duplicate tasks
- âœ… Worker logs show: "Email already processed, skipping"

---

## Cleanup Test Data

After testing, clean up:

```bash
cd /Users/aniketghode/development/SMILe\ Sales\ Funnel
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'worker/src')
from services.dynamodb_cleanup import DynamoDBCleanup

cleanup = DynamoDBCleanup(
    region='ap-south-1',
    table_prefix='smile-sales-funnel-prod'
)

result = cleanup.cleanup_all_user_data('aniket.ghode@shreemaruti.com')
print(f'Deleted: {result[\"total_deleted\"]} items')
print(f'Success: {result[\"success\"]}')
"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Processing
```bash
railway logs --service worker --tail 50
```

Look for:
- "ðŸ“§ Polling aniket.ghode@shreemaruti.com"
- "Found X new emails"
- "Starting openrouter LLM extraction"

### Rate Limit Errors
Look for: "Rate limit hit (attempt X/4). Retrying in Y.Xs..."

**This is EXPECTED** - the retry logic will automatically handle it.

### No Deals Extracted
- Check confidence scores in worker logs
- Low confidence â†’ draft (won't auto-create)
- Make sure email clearly mentions budget/value

### API Errors
```bash
railway logs --service api --tail 50
```

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Worker polls and processes emails
âœ… Retry logic handles rate limits
âœ… Tasks extracted correctly (with titles, priorities)
âœ… Deals extracted correctly (with values in INR)
âœ… Contacts extracted (name + email)
âœ… Deal stage progression works (lead â†’ contacted â†’ demo â†’ proposal)
âœ… Task status updates work (accepted â†’ in_progress â†’ completed)
âœ… Idempotency prevents duplicates
âœ… Multi-customer data properly separated
âœ… Cleanup removes all test data
