Dear SMILe Sales Team,

I'm reaching out on behalf of PharmaLogix, a pharmaceutical distribution company with ₹200 crore annual revenue. We're evaluating CRM solutions as part of our digital transformation initiative.

URGENT REQUESTS:
1. Send detailed proposal by Monday (Jan 22) - we have a board meeting Tuesday
2. Include pricing for 75 users
3. Arrange an online demo on Monday afternoon

DEAL DETAILS:
- Budget allocated: ₹25 lakhs for first year
- Looking for 2-year contract
- Decision to be made by Jan 31
- 75 sales reps across 12 cities need access

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:
1. Does it work offline? (Our field reps often have poor connectivity)
2. Can we customize reports for pharma-specific metrics?
3. Do you have existing clients in pharmaceutical industry?

Also, please send your company's GST details and registered office address for our vendor registration process.

Time is of the essence here - we need everything by Monday morning. Can you confirm you can meet this deadline?

Regards,
Vikram Singh
Director - Sales Operations
PharmaLogix India Pvt. Ltd.
