Hi Team,

Hope you're doing well. We're Tech Corp India, a fast-growing fintech company with 500+ employees across Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi.

We're evaluating CRM solutions and your AI-powered sales funnel looks promising. We're looking at a 3-year contract with the following requirements:

- 500 user licenses initially
- Gmail integration for the entire sales team (50 people)
- Custom reporting for management
- Mobile apps for field sales

Budget approved: ₹50 lakhs for first year, with potential for ₹1.5 crore over 3 years.

Could you please send a detailed proposal by next Friday (Jan 22)? We'd also like to schedule a demo for our leadership team sometime next week.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Rajesh Kumar
