## üöÄ Run It Now

### Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Check Docker
docker --version
# Should show: Docker version 20.x or higher

# Check Node.js
node --version
# Should show: v18.x or higher

# Check Python
python3 --version
# Should show: Python 3.9 or higher

# Check Ollama
ollama --version
# Should show: ollama version 0.x
```

### Start Ollama First

```bash
# In a separate terminal, start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull the model (one-time, ~2GB download)
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### Start the Demo

```bash
# From project root
make demo
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Start DynamoDB Local (Docker)
2. ‚úÖ Create database tables
3. ‚úÖ Start Worker (FastAPI + LangGraph)
4. ‚úÖ Start API (NestJS)
5. ‚úÖ Start UI (React + Vite)
6. ‚úÖ Open browser to http://localhost:5173

**Time:** ~30 seconds for everything to start

2. Click "Choose File"
3. Select `samples/deal-high-value.txt`
4. Click "Upload"
5. Wait 10-15 seconds
6. See extracted tasks and deals!

### Option 2: Via Command Line

```bash
# Run automated tests
make test
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Docker not found"
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop
# Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
# Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
```

### "Port 8001 already in use"
```bash
# Stop existing DynamoDB
docker stop smile-dynamodb
docker rm smile-dynamodb
./start-local.sh
```

### "Ollama not found"
```bash
# Install Ollama
# Mac: brew install ollama
# Or download from: https://ollama.ai

# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### "No data in UI"
```bash
# Check services are running
curl http://localhost:8000/  # Worker health
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # API health

# Check logs
tail -f logs/worker.log
tail -f logs/api.log
```

## üìù What's Different from Original Plan

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Local-first development (instead of AWS-first)
- DynamoDB Local setup (instead of production DynamoDB)
- All core features working locally
- Sample emails for testing
- One-command demo

### üîÑ Deferred to Phase 2
- Gmail API integration (using manual upload instead)
- AWS deployment
- Production DynamoDB
- Cost tracking (not relevant locally)

## üéØ Demo Checklist

Before showing stakeholders:

- [ ] Docker running
- [ ] Ollama running with llama3.2
- [ ] Run `make demo`
- [ ] Wait for "‚úÖ SMILe Sales Funnel is running"
- [ ] Open http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Upload `samples/deal-high-value.txt`
- [ ] Show extracted tasks (should see 1-2)
- [ ] Show extracted deals (should see 1 high-value)
- [ ] Click "Accept" to demonstrate action
- [ ] Check stats counters update

**Demo time: 2-3 minutes**

---

## üö¢ When Ready for AWS Deployment

Just change environment variables - no code changes needed!

```bash
# .env.production (future)
DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT=  # Empty = use AWS
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret>
```

The same code works for both local and cloud! ‚ú®
