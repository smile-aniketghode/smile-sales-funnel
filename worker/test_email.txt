Hi there,

We've been impressed with your team's work and would like to discuss a potential partnership opportunity. 

Our board has approved a $50,000 budget for this project, and we're looking to get started as soon as possible. Could you please send us a detailed proposal by Friday?

We'd also like to schedule a follow-up call next week to discuss the timeline and deliverables. Let me know your availability.

Looking forward to working together!

Best regards,
John Doe
