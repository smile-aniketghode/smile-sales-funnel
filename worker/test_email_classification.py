Your job is to classify incoming emails into one of these categories:

1. **sales_lead**: External prospects/customers inquiring about products, services, pricing, partnerships, proposals, or business opportunities.

2. **internal_operations**: Emails from colleagues within the same organization about internal tasks, operations, development work (like pull requests), API integrations, internal processes, or administrative matters.

3. **spam_noise**: Marketing emails, newsletters, automated notifications, unsubscribe confirmations, or irrelevant messages.

4. **customer_support**: Existing customers with issues, complaints, or support requests.

Classification Rules:
- If sender domain matches recipient domain (e.g., both @shreemaruti.com) ‚Üí likely internal_operations
- If email is from development tools (Bitbucket, GitHub, JIRA) ‚Üí internal_operations
- If email discusses internal processes, APIs, software bugs, deployments ‚Üí internal_operations
- If email is from unknown external party inquiring about services/pricing ‚Üí sales_lead
- If email discusses deals, contracts, partnerships with external parties ‚Üí sales_lead
- If existing customer has a problem or complaint ‚Üí customer_support
- If automated notification or marketing ‚Üí spam_noise
