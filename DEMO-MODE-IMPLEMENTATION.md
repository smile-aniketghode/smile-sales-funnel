### State Machine

```

  ↓         (1.5s)       (2s)          (2.5s)              (1s)                ↓

  ↓                                                                            ↓
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→ COMPLETE
```

### Sample Emails

1. **TechCorp** - ₹75L enterprise deal + proposal task
2. **ACME India** - Follow-up task only (shows AI doesn't hallucinate deals)
3. **BigCorp** - ₹1.5Cr large enterprise opportunity + meeting task
4. **Startup.io** - ₹25L deal + 3 tasks (multi-extraction)
5. **TechCorp (progression)** - Updates existing deal to negotiation stage

### Dependencies Added

- `framer-motion@^12.23.22` for animations

## Key Decisions

### ✅ Why This Approach Works

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Local state only** | No API calls, works offline, fast, repeatable |
| **Pre-computed extraction** | Consistent results, no LLM calls, no failures |
| **Reuses Dashboard components** | Looks exactly like real product |
| **Public route** | Zero friction - no signup/login barrier |
| **Realistic data** | Innofulfill logistics context, Indian currency |
| **Animated overlays** | Engaging, educational, shows AI "thinking" |

### ⚠️ Limitations (By Design)

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Can't customize emails | Clear CTA: "Connect YOUR Gmail to see real extraction" |
| Not real extraction | Labeled as "Demo Mode" with banner |
| Fixed sequence | Fast enough (~2 min) that replay isn't tedious |
| No hands-on interaction | Dashboard updates ARE interactive (shows working product) |

## Metrics to Track

Once deployed, measure:

1. **Demo start rate** - % of visitors who click "Start Processing"
2. **Completion rate** - % who finish all 5 emails
3. **Drop-off points** - Which email stage loses users
4. **CTA click rate** - % who click "Connect Your Gmail"
5. **Time on page** - Average demo duration
6. **Conversion to signup** - Demo → /login → actual auth

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Improvements

- [ ] Skip to specific email in sequence
- [ ] Adjustable processing speed (faster/slower)
- [ ] Share demo state via URL param
- [ ] A/B test different email sets
- [ ] Analytics events (GTM/Segment integration)
- [ ] Email 6-7 for longer demo option

### Alternative Uses

- **Conference booth mode** - Run on iPad, auto-loop
- **Sales deck embed** - iframe in pitch presentations
- **Onboarding tutorial** - New users see this first
- **Feature showcase** - Highlight specific extraction capabilities
