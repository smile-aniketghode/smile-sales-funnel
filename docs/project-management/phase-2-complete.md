## How to Test

### 1. Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Make sure all services are running
docker ps | grep smile-dynamodb  # Should show DynamoDB running
ps aux | grep "npm run start:dev"  # Should show API running

# Terminal 2: UI is running at http://localhost:5175
# (Already started)
```

### 2. Open Dashboard
**URL:** http://localhost:5175

You should see:
- Navigation bar with Dashboard/AI Inbox/Upload Email tabs
- 4 metric cards showing 0s (no data yet)
- Hot Deals widget with empty state
- Today's Tasks widget with "You're all caught up! 🎉"
- AI Insights panel with empty state

### 3. Upload Sample Data
```bash
# Upload a high-value deal
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingestEmail \
  -F "file=@samples/deal-high-value.txt"

# Wait 10-20 seconds for processing

# Refresh dashboard - you should see:
# - Revenue card updated
# - Active Deals count increased
# - Deal appears in Hot Deals widget
# - AI Insights shows recommendations
```

### 4. Test Navigation
- Click "AI Inbox" → Should show existing AI Inbox page
- Click "Upload Email" → Should show file upload interface
- Click "Dashboard" → Should return to dashboard

### 5. Test Quick Actions
Once you have tasks:
- Click checkbox on a task → Task marked complete and removed
- Click "Dismiss" → Task rejected and removed

## Known Issues

1. **Port 3000 Conflict**: API might have TypeScript warnings but functions correctly
2. **Empty States**: All widgets show empty states when no data - this is expected
3. **Company Names**: Hot Deals shows "Unknown Company" - will improve with company linking
